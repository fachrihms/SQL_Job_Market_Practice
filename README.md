This project explores: top-paying-jobs with health insurance, in-demand-skills, and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

For SQL queries kindly check them out here: [project_sql_folder](/project_sql/)

# Background

The question i wanted to answer using SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying-jobs?
3. What skills are most demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management (DBMS) ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My most used and familiar with text editor for database management and executing SQL queries
- **Git & GitHub:** Essensial for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspect of the data analyst job market.
Here is how I approached each quetion:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs and Location

This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_location,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_title,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_health_insurance,
    name as company_name,
    job_posted_date
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title LIKE 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    -- job_health_insurance IS TRUE
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 10;
```

Breakdown:

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles with health insurance span from $135,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Salary and Health Insurance:** The most high paying salary companies like Mantys and, Plexus is not providing Health Insurance instead Get It Recruit, Level, and Uber getting the health insurance for the employees
- **Skills demand:** SQL and Python mostly used by the top 3 company from this and most worth skills to learn

```sql

WITH skills_demand AS(
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(job_postings_fact.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM
        job_postings_fact

    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
), average_salary AS (
        SELECT
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) as avg_salary
    FROM

    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
        -- job_country = 'Singapore'
    GROUP BY
        skills_job_dim.skill_id
)

SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    avg_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE demand_count>10
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC

/* Rewrite this same query more concisely*/
SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(job_postings_fact.job_id) AS demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) as avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
        -- job_country = 'Singapore'
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
    COUNT(job_postings_fact.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

Here's a brief insight into the data:

1. Python and Tableau have significantly higher demand counts compared to other skills.
   Go (Golang) has the highest average salary, despite lower demand.
2. Some specialized skills like Snowflake and Azure have relatively high salaries and moderate demand.
3. Traditional programming languages like Java and C++ are present but not at the top in terms of demand or salary.

# What I Learned

Throughout this adventure, I've learned a lot about SQL from zero (knowing nothing) to one (a bit more knowledge SQL query) although i need to practice and learn more with this language to more sharpening my skills here are my most learned SQL toolkit while im learning:

- **Complex Query Crafting:** Advancing the art or advance SQL, merging tables so good and wielding WITH clauses for ninja-level temp table maneuvers
- **Data Aggregation:** Got cozy with GROUP BY and turned aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG() also ORDER BY into my data-summarizing sidekicks.
- **Analytical Insight:** Turning raw data into something that can make me know what the best decision to make through data.
